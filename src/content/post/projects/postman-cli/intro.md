Couple of months ago, i found a cool TUI framework for those write Rust. And wanted to write something using it, And then for some reason i decided to a postman alternative on terminal using this framework called [Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/).

Derived from [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) on JavaScript i named the project fetched, hinting the what the final implementation usupposed to do.

Yes, I am currently working on the proeject, I usually work on the projects, but sometimes i manage to find some time to work on the project after my 9 to 5. And with all these efforts i expect to complete project soon as i can while write some blogs here on the progess on the project. I'll make sure to tag each blog from this project taged [#fetched](https://w0rth.dev/tags/fetched/), so you can filter all other crap and read posts only about this.

For those who wants to take a look at the code you can find it [here](https://github.com/n3tw0rth/fetched).
