Couple of months ago, i found a cool TUI framework for those write Rust. And wanted to write something using it, And for some reason i decided to write a postman alternative on terminal using this framework called [Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/).

Derived from [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) on JavaScript i named the project fetched, hinting what the final implementation supposed to do.

Yes, still the project is in development, here and there i manage to find some time to work on the project after my 9 to 5. And with all efforts i expect to complete project soon as i can while writing some blogs here on the progess on the project. I'll make sure to tag each blog on this project taged [#fetched](https://w0rth.dev/tags/fetched/), so you can filter all other crap and read these posts.

For those who wants to take a look at the code you can find it [here](https://github.com/n3tw0rth/fetched).
